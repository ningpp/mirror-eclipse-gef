/**
 * A {@link BindingAnnotation} that can be used to qualify adapter (map)
 * bindings, i.e. provide type information related to valid {@link IAdaptable}
 * injection points.
 * <p>
 * Clients should not use it directly, but rather query
 * {@link AdapterMaps#getAdapterMapBinder(com.google.inject.Binder, Class)} to
 * obtain a map binder that already qualifies its bindings with the respective
 * {@link AdapterMap} annotation for a given type. Adapter (map) bindings can
 * then be specified as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Obtain a map binder bound to MyAdaptable.
 * MapBinder&lt;AdapterKey&lt;?&gt;, Object&gt; adapterMapBinder = AdapterMaps.getAdapterMapBinder(binder(), MyAdaptable.class);
 *
 * // Bind instance of raw type 'A' as adapter with 'default' role to each MyAdaptable instance.
 * // The AdapterKey does not have to specify the adapter type, as it can be inferred from the binding and/or the adapter instance.
 * adapterMapBinder.addBinding(AdapterKey.defaultRole()).to(A.class);
 *
 * // Bind instance of parameterized type 'B&lt;A&gt;' as adapter with 'r' role to each MyAdaptable instance.
 * // The AdapterKey does not have to specify the adapter type, as it can be inferred from the binding.
 * adapterMapBinder.addBinding(AdapterKey.role("r").to(new TypeLiteral&lt;B&lt;A&gt;&gt;(){});
 *
 * // Bind instance 'c' of parameterized type 'C&lt;A&gt;' as adapter with 'r' role to each MyAdaptable instance.
 * // The AdapterKey has to specify the adapter type, as it cannot be inferred from the binding or adapter instance.
 * adapterMapBinder.addBinding(AdapterKey.get(new TypeToken&lt;C&lt;A&gt;&gt;(){}, "r").toInstance(c);
 * </pre>
 *
 * If an {@link IAdaptable} marks itself as eligible for adapter injection (see
 * {@link InjectAdapters}), all adapter (map bindings) that are bound to a
 * {@link AdapterMap#adaptableType() type} (by being qualified with a respective
 * {@link AdapterMap} annotation), which is either the same or a super-type or
 * super-interface of the {@link IAdaptable} will be evaluated, and respective
 * adapters will be injected.
 * <p>
 * If the {@link AdapterMap} specifies a {@link AdapterMap#adaptableContext()
 * context}, adapters will only be injected, if the adaptable is itself resides
 * within a compatible context.
 * <p>
 * In order to enable adapter injection, {@link AdapterInjectionSupport} has to
 * be installed by one of the {@link Module}s used by the {@link Injector}.
