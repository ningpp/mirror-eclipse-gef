	 * <p>
	 * The change may internally consist of several elementary sub-changes,
	 * which are related to changes of a single element. That is, a call to
	 * {@link ObservableMultiset#add(Object)} or
	 * {@link ObservableMultiset#setCount(Object, int)} will lead to an atomic
	 * change that comprises only a single elementary sub-change, while a call
	 * to {@link ObservableMultiset#clear()} will potentially lead to several
	 * elementary sub-changes (one for each element contained in the Multiset).
	 * <p>
	 * The comprised elementary sub-changes need to be navigated using
	 * {@link #next()}, the relevant information can then be retrieved via
	 * {@link #getElement()}, {@link #getAddCount()}, and
	 * {@link #getRemoveCount()} (for the current elementary sub-change the
	 * internal cursor currently points at). Initially, the internal cursor is
	 * set to point before the first elementary sub-change, so that an initial
	 * call to {@link #next()} is required to access the first elementary
	 * sub-change, while {@link #reset()} can be used to reset the cursor to
	 * this initial state before the first elementary sub-change.
	 * <p>
	 * The {@link #getMultiset()} returns the source {@link ObservableMultiset}
	 * that was changed (in the state after the atomic change was applied). The
	 * previous contents of the source {@link ObservableMultiset} (in the state
	 * before the atomic change was applied) can be obtained via
	 * {@link #getPreviousContents()}. Both are independent of the state of the
	 * internal cursor and may be accessed at any time.
