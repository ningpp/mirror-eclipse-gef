 * After the scope has been entered for an {@link IAdaptable} instance (which
 * automatically switches the scope to this {@link IAdaptable} instance), the
 * {@link AdaptableScope} will maintain a set of scoped objects for the

 *
 * The scoped provider being returned by {@link #scope(Key, Provider)} will
 * always (recycle) objects from this set of scoped objects, only creating new
 * instances if a respective instance is not already contained in the set of
 * scoped objects. It will always refer to the set of scoped objects bound to
 * the {@link IAdaptable} instance the scope was switched to last, preserving
 * the set of objects instances for all other {@link IAdaptable} instances.
 * <p>
 * Leaving the scope for an {@link IAdaptable} instance will clear the set of
 * scoped objects for this {@link IAdaptable} instance, so no scoped objects may
 * be recycled afterwards. The {@link AdaptableScope} will have to be re-entered
 * for the {@link IAdaptable} instance after it has been left for it.
