/**
 * The {@link ICurve} interface provides operations that allow the analysis of
 * linear geometric objects and the transfer to {@link BezierCurve} segments (
 * {@link #toBezier()}). The start and end {@link Point} of an {@link ICurve}
 * can be retrieved using its {@link #getP1()} and {@link #getP2()} methods.
 * Furthermore, you can search for {@link Point}s of intersection using the
 * {@link #getIntersections(ICurve)} method. If you do only need to know if
 * there are any intersections, and you are not interested in their exact
 * locations, then you can use the {@link #intersects(ICurve)} method, instead.
 * To test for an overlap, i.e. an identical segment of two {@link ICurve}s, use
 * the {@link #overlaps(ICurve)} method. One may think that an overlap is a very
 * rare case. But in practical application, objects are usually aligned to a
 * grid, which extremely increases the probability of an overlap.
